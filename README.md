# GA-1st-project
This will be my first attempt at an XCOM style game.

I mainly used jQuery for this project. I also tried to use a few constructor functions, and whilst they did their job, they were not the driest code I could have written

Scrapped ideas
- See terrain statistics on mouseover. This was scrapped as I ran out of time.
- Health bar. This was not scrapped as much as incomplete. The health bars are up, but they do not have the colours of the teams, only the default blue. This was because I could not figure out how to change the colour of the progress bar.
- Accuracy per bullet. I was looking to work out a hit/miss per bullet per attack, with encompassing animation. I scrapped this due to lack of time and also not being able to get the animation right.
- Additional Terrain. I wanted to add in additional terrain types, addng in a different tactical perspective to the map. This was scrapped due to lack of time
- Additional maps and stories. I wanted to add in additional content, but again (sounding like a broken record), I ran out of time.
- Extra customistion options on start menu. It was too big a job in the time available. Although I suspect that this would have been easy if I had written my code well.

Known problems/bugs
I have one know bug. The weapon attack range grid goes to the opposite end of the screen (left to right/vice versa). I didn't have enough time to fix it - and I only had a vague idea of how this could be done.

Issues
Main issue is that I have a lot of duplicate code, written in haste. The main thing that I need to learn how to do is to learn to dry up my code.

The other issue that I have is that I'm a little scatterbrained when I come to my project - I dart around too much and think of/start too many things.
